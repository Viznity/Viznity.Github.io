specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise
mutually agreed by the parties; (c) the arbitrator may award injunctive or declaratory relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to
provide relief warranted by that party&rsquo;s individual claim; and (d) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
